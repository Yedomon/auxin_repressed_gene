### ABA regulation

> Recently, key regulators of ABA biosynthesis or signaling pathway have been characterized: LEC2, ABI3, and DOG1 in Arabidopsis [[11], [12], [13], [14]]; TaPHS1 and TaMFT in wheat [2,15]; VP1 in maize [16]; and OsFbx352, OsNCED3, OsPDS, OsCRTISO, β-OsLCY, OsZDS, OsVP1, Sdr4, OsDSG1, OsABI3, OsABI5, PHS8, PHS9, and OsMFT2 in rice [1,7,[17], [18], [19], [20], [21], [22], [23], [24], [25], [26], [27], [28], [29], [30]]. All of these genes control seed dormancy, but their regulatory mechanisms remain elusive.
